    Running clock generation algorithm ...
    For FAMILY is other than virtex5, using DCM architecture
    Step 1: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 90 or 270 degree
        Group: DCM0 ot DCM1 or DCM2 or DCM3
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 2: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 0 or 180 degree
        Group: DCM0 ot DCM1 or DCM2 or DCM3
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 3: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: Non 0|90|180|270 degree fine phase shift
        Group: DCM0 ot DCM1 or DCM2 or DCM3
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 4: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 90|270 degree
        Group: NONE
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 5: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 0|180 degree
        Group: NONE
        Not external feedback
      }
      There are 1 required clocks are not generated
      Try to generate 1 of them in this step
      Required clock: CLKOUT0
      1. Try to use already instanced DCM's CLKOUTs
        { Try to use instanced DCM's CLKOUT for CLKOUT0
          Can not connect CLKGEN's CLKOUT0 to instanced DCM
        }
      2. Try to instance a DCM and connect to CLKGEN's CLKIN then use its CLKOUTs
        { Try to instance DCM and connect its CLKIN to CLKIN
          Instance DCM0 from CLKGEN's CLKIN
        }
        { Try to use instanced DCM's CLKOUT for CLKOUT0
            try any-group DCM0
          Connect CLKGEN's CLKOUT0 to DCM0.CLK0
        }
    Step 6: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: Non 0|90|180|270 degree fine phase shift
        Group: NONE
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 7: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 0 degree
        Group: NONE
        External feedback
      }
    Summary of using DCM only architecture
      All required clocks are successfully generated
